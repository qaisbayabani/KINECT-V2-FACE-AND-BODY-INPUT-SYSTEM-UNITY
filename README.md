DONT BE SO HAPPY BECAUSE YOU STILL NEED A FOLDER CONTAINING .DLL FILES BY MICROSOFT FREELY PROVIDED i.e https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IsXeikLIJe1XS-9BGy82KXMf3bpvoDzL/view?usp=sharing BUT SEEMS TO BE WORKING ONLY WITH UNITY PAID VERSIONS IF YOU HAVE UNITY PRO YOU ARE GOOD TO GO AT THIS STAGE BUT IF YOU HAVE FREE EDITION, FOR YOU, I HAVE CRACKED IT FOR FREE EDITION AND YOU JUST HAVE TO COPY AND PASTE THE.DLL FILES IN PLUGIN FOLDER OF PROJECT READY TO GO.

IF ANY ONE WANTS THAT .DLL PLUGIN FOLDER SIMPLY ASK IT IN ISSUE AND GIVE EMIAL AND HAVE THE DRIVE LINK.
